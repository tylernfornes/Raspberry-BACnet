# Modbus SCADA Project
This project was originally intended to provide scripts to deploy a BACnet network on a raspberry pi with a temperature sensor and two colored lights. If the temperature rises above a given threshold, the lights will change (one will go off and the other will come on).

# Dependencies
```
pip install pymodbus
pip install Twisted
```
