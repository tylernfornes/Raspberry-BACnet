# Modbus SCADA Project
This project was originally intended to provide scripts to deploy a BACnet network on a raspberry pi with a temperature sensor and two colored lights. If the temperature rises above a given threshold, the lights will change (one will go off and the other will come on).

To deploy on Raspbian, run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/tylernfornes/Raspberry-SCADA
cd Raspberry-SCADA
./deploy.sh
```
